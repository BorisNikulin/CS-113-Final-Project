Meeting notes (12/09/2016):

	      Main -> Initializes components
	Controller -> Listens for events & calls view methods
	      View -> Changes images based on controller property bindings

	handleStep() calls pathfinder.step()
	handlePlay() calls pathFinder.play()
		- call step
		- call sleep/pause
		- check if goal is reached/boolean is false
		- loop
	handleStop() changes isPlay boolean
	
	TODO:
		- Create sequence diagram for controller
		- Make GraphUtility generic (add function interface to get coordinates)
		- Finish testing class
		- Add lines to view for each edge added
		- Change AStar path finding method to step() (while -> if)
		- Create connection to view in controller
		- Initialize controller in main
